<p>After the successful conclusion of the Five Major Treatises exam on January 30th, with two weeks remaining until Chinese New Year's Eve (February 16th),
the monks had a sudden inspiration: Let's create some joy in the snow, adding festive cheer and laughter to PEI.</p>
<p>Thus, over 100 monks braved sub-zero temperatures for three consecutive days,
shoveling and sculpting snow by hand to create a snowman world that invites people to pause, smile, and wander.</p>

<p>
It's been bitterly cold these days—
Morning lows hit -18°C, and while afternoons reached -6°C, the wind cut straight through you.
Monk robes, padded jackets, and long coats all came out, but the only thing that kept us warm from head to toe was... insulated coveralls.

A little one braved the outdoors for 3 hours, drank three cups of hot cocoa, yet still shivered uncontrollably, and was finally “ordered” back indoors to warm up.
Everyone returning had rosy cheeks and red hands.
Some frantically blew their feet with hair dryers, while others laughed, “Just grabbing snow makes your whole body freeze.”

But precisely because of this,
this snowy field was filled with laughter, mutual care, and warmth.

When the sun emerged, the snow glistened,
making not only the snowmen beautiful, but the children's eyes sparkle too.

We sincerely invite neighbors and friends:
📍 Come take a stroll
📍 Come see
📍 Feel simple, genuine joy in the snow

This isn't just a snow sculpture—
it's a **New Year blessing we wish to share with everyone.**

(Also quietly noting: If we do this again next year, we must prepare all warm gear—equipment truly impacts happiness and efficiency!)
