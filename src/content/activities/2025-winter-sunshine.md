<p>At today's Food Box preparation site, no grand slogans echoed—only the steady rhythm of footsteps and the gentle sound of supplies being placed. Monks bent down, using their most sincere hands to neatly stack the public's kindness. Each box carries a warm hope. As supplies piled into towers, our hearts joined in prayer: May the world be free from hunger, may all beings find peace.</p>

<p>Every jar of food, every box of supplies undergoes meticulous inspection and handling by the monastic community. This is not merely stacking goods—it is the careful packaging of compassion for all beings into each Food Box.</p>

<p>From fresh potatoes and crimson tomatoes to nutrient-rich canned goods and snacks, the diverse array reflects the convergence of public compassion. The gesture of monks personally delivering these items symbolizes Buddhism's warm consolation for society's impoverished, praying each recipient finds fullness of body and mind.</p>

<p>As preparations draw to a close, monks pose together behind a neatly arranged “Great Wall of Supplies.” Their genuine smiles radiate the joy of serving others (Service through Joy). This moment captures the power of compassion—when people unite, they build a solid shield to protect the vulnerable.</p>
