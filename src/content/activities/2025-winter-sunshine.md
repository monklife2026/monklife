<p>At today's Food Box preparation site, no grand slogans echoed—only the steady rhythm of footsteps and the gentle sound of supplies being placed. Monks bent down, using their most sincere hands to neatly stack the public's kindness. Each box carries a warm hope. As supplies piled into towers, our hearts joined in prayer: May the world be free from hunger, may all beings find peace.</p>

<p>Every jar of food, every box of supplies undergoes meticulous inspection and handling by the monastic community. This is not merely stacking goods—it is the careful packaging of compassion for all beings into each Food Box.</p>

<p>From fresh potatoes and bright red tomatoes to nutritious canned goods and snacks, may every recipient find fulfillment in both body and mind.</p>

<p>As preparations drew to a close, the monks posed for a group photo behind the neatly arranged “Great Wall of Supplies.” This moment crystallized the power of compassion—when people unite as one, they can build a solid shield to protect the vulnerable.</p>
